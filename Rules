RULES
 - Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
 - You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.
 
Details
 - The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
 - If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
 - If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
 - A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.
